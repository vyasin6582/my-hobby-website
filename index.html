<h1>Dancing Is My Hobby</h1>

<p>My hobby is dancing because I like to move to the beat to any song.
The type of dancing I like isn't considered really dancing because it
isn't ballet,tap, nor is it jazz. I don't do recitals or competitons it's just 
for when I'm bored so it doesn't have a catergory.</p> 

<h2> Videos</h2>


<p>Another thing about dancing is making videos to go back and look at later.
I use apps like dubsmash,thriller,and lomtiff to put it all together.
On the weekend I could make like 15,not including the ones I mess up on.
I really dance when I'm washing dishes,that's why I don't mind doing the dishes.</p>

<h3>Type Of Dancing</h3>

<p>The dances I do are like the little dances that the older people call "stupid"
which it is but it's simple and fun,the real names to the dances are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVYE88RMd4E">hit them folks</a>
,dabbin, reverseing the nae-nae,and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejj2jelfzmU
">milly rockin</a>
but I also like dancing to the hispanic music,like how you can just move your hips and feet with the beat.
I like doing it in a group because it makes it more hype and its more enjoyable.</p>

<h4>Music</h4>

<p> The thing about dancing is that you need to have music so thats another hobby, listening to music while dancing.
I can dance to no music but I prefer to have music so I don't look crazy.
Any type of music gets me in the mood to dance so whatever it is I'm dancing.
The specific music I listen to is hip hop, because the dances I do are from hip hop artist.</p>
